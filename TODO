Short-term plans
====================
- Make "show advanced timeouts" actually display them
- Enable script to be run on WiFi on/off


Mid-term plan
=============
- Enable modifying of profile settings
- Show current SIM/operator information

Wishlist
========
- GPS status screen
- See/set date, time and timezone
- Implement GLIB mainloop so we get DBUS signals and async calls
  (or look into using e_dbus)
- Show/Start/Stop services (init.d)
- add a --restore command line option, that gets called on startup and sets all those settings that are not properly set by frameworkd.
- Add a shortcuts module that allows to run user-defined commands on a button press.
- Bluetooth settings
- somehow connman integration... (unclear yet)
- Some kind of volume slider

DONE :-)
========
- Enable profile switching
- Implement command line options (start a module directly)
  This would enable a profile switcher from the AUX key
- Show current profile settings (ring-tone, volume, etc)
