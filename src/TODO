Short-term plans
====================

- Enable profile switching
- Implement command line options (start a module directly)
  This would enable a profile switcher from the AUX key
- Show current profile settings (ring-tone, volume, etc)

Mid-term plan
=============
- Make "show advanced timeouts" actually display them
- Enable script to be run on WiFi on/off
- Enable modifying of profile settings

Wishlist
========
- GPS status screen
- See/set date, time and timezone
- Implement GLIB mainloop so we get DBUS signals and async calls
  (or look into using e_dbus)
- Show/Start/Stop services (init.d)
